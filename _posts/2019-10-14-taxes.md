Last week, the New York Times published [an Op-Ed by David Leonhardt](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/10/06/opinion/income-tax-rate-wealthy.html) about how tax rates in America have changed over the past 70 years. The piece is based on recent work by the economists Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman, who argue that total taxes paid by the wealthiest Americans have dropped substantially since 1950. 

Whether or not that claim is true is not my concern today. I want to talk about the choices the NYT made in presenting the Saez-Zucman tax data. 

The article is centered around a slick visualization of what Leonhardt calls the "total tax rate" for different income levels. As you scroll downwards, data from different years shows up on the plot moving closer and closer to the present day. Here is a screenshot of where we end up:

Leonhardt's thesis is that the tax rates on the super wealthy have dropped consistently since 1950, resulting in a relatively flat "total tax rate" for all income levels. The presentation of this data undermines this thesis more than the data supports it. The two reasons why are both fundamental:

1) The quantities being plotted are not all clearly defined.
======

2) The axes are misleading.
======

Those points are all equally spaced/sized, but some of them represent 400 people and others represent 10% of the population.

The reason that the x-axis matters to me is that all those grid lines being equidistant on the plot imply that they correspond to equal portions of the population. Furthermore, the points are equally spaced and have connecting lines between them, further implying that they are continuously showing the relationship across equal chunks of population. The first time I looked through this, I came away with the impression that taxes had dropped significantly for not only the super rich, but the top 15-20% of income-earners, because that is the approximate portion of the x-axis over which taxes drop since 1950. Only after looking at the small and light grey axis labels did I realize that I had been misled. On top of that, the y axis is zoomed in to go from 10% to 75%, rather than from 0% to 100%, which would more clearly show the relative scale of tax rate changes. I acknowledge that that last bit might just be my personal preference. 

In any case, my point is that somebody glancing over this article that is in the top 15-20% of incomes might take away the message that THEIR taxes need to go up. Now they may be more resistant to Zucman-Saez-Warren type tax reform, and not understand that the point is to raise taxes on the top 0.1-1% income range. Fox News can show this graphic and immediately alienate their middle class/upper middle class viewers. On top of that, for me as a liberal who would otherwise be sympathetic to the message of the article, when I see such a lazy and misleading data visualization, now I am more likely to be skeptical of other claims made based on this data, because I just experienced an attempt to manipulate my thoughts. Good data visualization reveals what the data is saying without trying to speak on behalf of the data.

I went ahead and plotted their data for a sample of years and showed what it looks like on normal axes. See attached for a gif that loops through six years from 1950 to 2018. The story is now clear that the tax burden of the very top of the income distribution has plummeted, while everybody else's seems to have risen slightly. To show in more detail what is happening at 99%, 99.9%, etc., one can either do another plot that is zoomed in, or use a logarithmic axis.

A few days later, there was [another NYT Op-Ed written by Saez and Zucman themselves](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/11/opinion/sunday/wealth-income-tax-rate.html?action=click&module=Opinion&pgtype=Homepage). Take a look at the bar graphs they present. The authors break down "total tax rate" to show exactly what they include in this quantity. Axes are clearly defined in a non-misleading way. Overall, a significant improvement over the previous Op-Ed. Of course, the bar graphs don't present any how any of these rates as a function of time. Nobody said data visualization was easy!

Technical Details
------
Code used for gathering data, analysis, and plot generation can be found here (LINK TO GITHUB). Mostly standard matplotlib. I used FuncAnimation from matplotlib.animation for the first time. I found [this introduction](https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2016/drawing-animated-gifs-with-matplotlib/) useful for figuring it out.
