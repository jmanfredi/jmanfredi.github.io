Several years ago while visiting my parents I found a book I had read back in high school. I remembered when I got the book, I remember reading it...and nothing else! I had no idea if I liked it or hated it, or any details of the plot or characters. It was like running into a familiar face in the street, when you *know* that you know that face and have not the slightest clue from where.

I thought this was a shame, because I love books. All kinds. Of course they have educational value: much of my worldview was forged with a book in my hands. More than that though books allow you to come as close as possible to inhabiting the brain of another human being, and I find that thrilling. In this sense, a book is truly an adventure. When I discovered that book in my childhood bedroom I was saddened that I had no record in my memory or otherwise of the impact that this particular adventure had on me. And not only on me, but the *me of that particular time and place*. To borrow from Heraclitus, you can't read the same book twice because you are a different person each time you read it.

So shortly after finding this book, I started keeping more careful track of the books that I read. 

In 2019, I read 30 books.
