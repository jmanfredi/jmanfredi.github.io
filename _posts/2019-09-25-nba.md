The rise of analytics in the NBA has led to the realization that *mid-range shots* (those that come from outside of the key but inside of the three-point line) are a relatively inefficient way to score points. This has resulted in a [league-wide abandonment of the mid-range jumper](https://flowingdata.com/2019/01/15/goodbye-mid-range-shot/) in favor of a [tremendous increase in three-point shots](https://www.theringer.com/nba/2019/2/27/18240583/3-point-boom-nba-daryl-morey). Now, I am all for using statistics to be better at sports, but those of us that watched legends like Michael Jordan or Dirk Nowitzki in their heyday can't help but feel a pang of sadness. Rationality be damned, seeing Kobe Bryant shoot an off-balance long two over a defender's outstretched hands was pure magic. Moments like that are the reason people watch basketball in the first place.

Unfortunately, although I am a basketball romantic, mathematics is definitely not. To see what I mean, take a look at the clip below.

{% include streamablePlayer.html id=page.streamableId %}

Dennis Smith Jr. considers taking a wide-open three, and then steps forward to instead take a long two. This was a bad decision. The two point shot DSJ chose to take is only slightly easier than the three that he passed up, but the latter one also had a 50% higher point reward! That's like only reading the left pages of a book. Or like deliberately picking an ugly outfit for a first date. Why make life harder for yourself? Look, I know the Knicks are an easy target, but this example just illustrated my point too perfectly for me to not use it.

For the same reason you might bury your face into your palm while watching that clip, teams are encouraging their players to shoot more and more from outside the three-point line. So we can expect the mid-range to continue floundering into obscurity. This reality, after all, is dictated by the rules of the game. But...what if, just for fun, we changed the rules?

The New Math of the Bizarro NBA
======
Legend has it that Antoine Walker was once asked why he shot so many threes. His response: "Because there are no fours". Walker himself was not a great shooter, but he raises an interesting point: what if shots were worth something besides two or three points? After all, it seems fair that a 28-foot shot should be worth more than a 24-foot shot which should be worth more than a 15-foot shot. 

Imagine an alternate Bizarro universe, where Bizarro NBA Commissioner Adam Silver proclaims that in the 2019-2020 season of the Bizarro NBA, shot values will be adjusted. One can imagine more lines added to the court to indicate a four-point distance, a 2.5-point distance, etc. But that would look terrible and is in fact not at all necessary. [Modern video technology](http://grantland.com/features/the-toronto-raptors-sportvu-cameras-nba-analytical-revolution/) can track all ten players on the court for every minute of every game, and so it's easy to figure out where on the floor each shot originated from. This allows us to ask the question: **what if the value of every NBA shot was determined by the exact distance of the shot from the hoop?**

Let's say that a shot taken right underneath the hoop is worth the old familiar 2 points, and that a shot taken exactly at the three-point line at the top of the key is worth 3 points. For a given shot distance \\( x \\), the point value of the shot is given by
\\(
N(x) = 2 + cx
\\)

where \\( c \\) is a constant defined so that a 23.75 foot shoot is worth exactly 3 points (i.e. \\( N(23.75) = 3 \\) ).

We can visualize what this new points system looks like by considering DeMar DeRozan, one of the few mid-range specialists surviving in the modern NBA. Below are two shot charts that show the starting locations of every single shot that DeRozan made during the 2018-19 NBA season, with the point values of each shot indicated by the color of the corresponding dot. The left chart shows the point values for the real NBA scoring system, and the right chart shows the point values when using our new Bizarro system.

On the left, all of those purple dots are worth exactly two points and the yellow dots are worth three. On the right there is a continuous range of colors since each dot has an individual value depending on how far away the dot is from the basket. All of a sudden, what were previously DeRozan's long two's are now two-point-eight's, and DeRozan's style goes from being an outdated throwback to a potentially valuable strategy.

BNBA All-Stars
======

We can make a list of every single shot taken during the 2018-19 NBA season, and calculate how many points that shot would be worth in the Bizarro NBA by using the distance from the shooter to the hoop. Then for each player, we can add up all the shots he took to get a new Bizarro point total. This plot compares the 

That red line indicates players who have the same exact ranking in both cases. Dots below the line have a better ranking in the new system, and dots above the line have a better ranking in the new system. Although there are certainly some players that are impacted, nobody really moves into a new echelon of scoring prowess, for better or for worse.

NEW IDEA for organization
-Show real points vs new points...does not seem like a big change
-Who benefits the most from this change? 
-Conclude

We can look at the last full NBA season (2018-2019) and see which current NBA players would benefit (or suffer) the most from this bizarro point system. One question to ask: how does a player's scoring output compared to the league average in the real NBA change with the Bizarro NBA point system? (In this case, I am ignoring all points from free throws: the only that matters is points that come from a made basket during the normal flow of the game.) We can consider a player's performance boost, which I define as the change in a player's scoring output compared to the league average scoring output. So, if Player X scores 10% more points than the average player in the real NBA, but 15% more than the average player in the Bizarro NBA, then his performance boost would be 15 - 10 = 5%. You would expect that the players that take a higher fraction of their shots in the mid-range (like Demar DeRozan) would get bigger performance boosts. And that is in fact the case: the following plot shows the performance boost vs. the percentage of a player's shots that come from the area further than 10 ft away from the hoop and closer than the three point line.

![change-plot](/images/for-posts/nba/change-plot.png){:class="img-responsive"}

Each dot corresponds to one player, and the size relates to the number of shots taken by that player. The general trend is that the more mid-range shots a player takes, the more likely this new point system is to benefit him. There are clearly three players who benefit the most from this system. Demar DeRozan and Lamarcus Aldridge are both known for taking a lot of jump shots, so it's not surprising to see their dots so high up. But I was surprised by the third name: Kevin Durant. He's already so dominant offensively...and this would make him even better.

At the lower left corner, you see James Harden's dot (which is the biggest because he takes the most shots), meaning that he gets slightly worse compared to the average player. This makes sense, as Harden prioritizes taking shots either very close to the hoop or at the three-point line, both of which are not increased much in the Bizarro NBA.

We can rank all the NBA players in the 2018-19 season both by the real number of points they scored as well as by the hypothetical Bizarro points. Here is a plot that compares the rankings for both for the top 100 scorers. 

![rank-plot](/images/for-posts/nba/rank-plot.png){:class="img-responsive"}

In the end, the Bizarro NBA might not look all that different from what we have here in the real universe. And whether this change would even make the game more exciting is unclear. On the one hand, imagine a team hitting a six-point full-court buzzer-beater to win the game! One the other hand, ties (and therefore overtime) are far less likely. One thing is clear though: we should enjoy KD while we can, since he is the closest thing we have to a modern-day Black Mamba. In this case, calling him a snake is a compliment.

Technical Details
------
Code used for gathering data, analysis, and plot generation can be found [here](https://github.com/jmanfredi/shot-data). The data for this project was collected using the stats.nba.com API, and the analysis was done using standard Python packages.

Some caveats. First, this post completely neglects free throws, which make up about 15% of all points scored in the NBA. Second, a change in the rules would influence player and team strategy. I have no doubt that James Harden could dominate in the mid-range, if he wanted to. Third, the bizarro point system is not normalized to the old point system, so the value of each point is dilluted slightly.

I am surely just scratching the surface of this Bizarro universe. How are efficiency statistics affected? Which shots are now the most valuable? Which defenders get more or less valuable? Any other ideas? Or is there another NBA rule change that would be fun to think about?

I thought a lot about whether I should normalize the bizarro points system to the real one. E.g., I could make \\( c \\) equal to whatever value allowed the total number of real points scored from field goals to be equal to the total number of bizarro points scored from field goals. This would have allowed for the PPG stats to be compared on the same exact scale between the two points systems, and also keeps the relative importance of free throws constant (for calculating efficiency metrics). In the end I decided against this for two reasons. First, there are two parameters to vary in the equation for \\( N(x) \\), and it was not clear the best way to constrain one or the other. Second, I wanted to preserve the intuitive nature of the boundary conditions described above. 

For drawing the court lines in the shot chart, I used code from [Savvas Tjortjoglou](https://github.com/savvastj/nbashots).
