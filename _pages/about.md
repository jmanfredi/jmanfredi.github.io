I am a Postdoctoral Scholar at the University of California Berkeley with [Bethany Goldblum](https://appliedphysics.nuc.berkeley.edu/about/) in the Department of Nuclear Engineering. Most of my work takes place at the [88-Inch Cyclotron](http://cyclotron.lbl.gov/) up the hill from campus at Lawrence Berkely National Laboratory, and at [Sandia National Laboratories in Livermore](https://www.sandia.gov/locations/livermore_california.html). 

I graduated with a B.A. in Math and Physics from Washington University in St. Louis, where I worked with [Lee Sobotka](https://artsci.wustl.edu/faculty-staff/lee-sobotka) on nuclear structure and nuclear astrophysics. Then I earned a PhD at Michigan State University, working with [Betty Tsang](https://people.nscl.msu.edu/~tsang/) at the [National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory](https://www.nscl.msu.edu/).
