Welcome!

I am a Postdoctoral Scholar at the University of California Berkeley with [Bethany Goldblum](https://appliedphysics.nuc.berkeley.edu/about/). I spend a lot of time at the [88-Inch Cyclotron](http://cyclotron.lbl.gov/) at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, and also at [Sandia National Laboratories in Livermore](https://www.sandia.gov/locations/livermore_california.html). I am usually thinking about neutrons, and all the ways they can benefit society.

I got my PhD in nuclear physics at Michigan State University with [Betty Tsang](https://people.nscl.msu.edu/~tsang/). Before that I went to Washington University in St. Louis, where I worked with [Lee Sobotka](https://artsci.wustl.edu/faculty-staff/lee-sobotka). 

For more details, check out my CV. For my thoughts on non-physics topics, check out the blog.
